Hospital Management System (MERN Stack)
Description
The Hospital Management System is a web-based application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). It is designed to help hospitals manage their infrastructure more efficiently by digitizing key administrative tasks like room management and facility tracking.

The system provides a clean and responsive interface for staff to manage rooms, view available facilities, and handle day-to-day hospital logistics. It aims to improve patient service and reduce manual workload for hospital administrators.
